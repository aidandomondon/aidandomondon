### Welcome to Aidan Domondon's GitHub Page 

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aidan, a recent grad from Northeastern University.

I studied Computer Science and Math.

Broadly, I'm interested in:
- Web Development
- Data Analysis, Engineering, and Visualization
- Desktop Development
- Machine Learning

I write software such as:
- A [privacy-focused, offline chatbot](https://github.com/aidandomondon/tarragon) that you can talk to about your personal documents.
- A [mental-health-forward social network](https://github.com/aidandomondon/comebacksunday) with engineered breaks to prevent doomscrolling and digital overconsumption.
- A [personal website](https://aidandomondon.github.io) to showcase my professional and academic endeavors.
